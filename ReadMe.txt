Let's begin\!

## **Part 1: Understanding the Basics (Makefiles)**

### **1.1 What is a Build System and Why Do We Need One?**

Imagine you have a C++ project with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of source code files.
If you were to compile them manually, you'd type something like:
`g++ -c file1.cpp`
`g++ -c file2.cpp`
...
`g++ -o my_program file1.o file2.o ...`

This quickly becomes:

  * **Tedious:** Too many commands to type.
  * **Error-prone:** Easy to miss a file or make a typo.
  * **Inefficient:** If you change only `file1.cpp`, you don't want to recompile `file2.cpp` and all other files that haven't changed.

A **build system** (like `make`, `ninja`, `msbuild`, `bazel`, etc.) automates this process. It reads a configuration file (like a `Makefile`) that describes:

  * Which source files depend on which other files.
  * How to compile individual source files into object files.
  * How to link object files into executables or libraries.
  * How to perform other build-related tasks (like cleaning up generated files).

The primary benefit is **incremental builds**: the build system only recompiles what's necessary based on file changes, saving immense time on large projects.

### **1.2 Introduction to `make` and `Makefile` Syntax**

`make` is a command-line utility that reads a file named `Makefile` (or `makefile`) in the current directory.

A `Makefile` consists of **rules**. Each rule has:

  * A **target**: The file to be generated (e.g., `my_program`, `main.o`).
  * **Dependencies (prerequisites)**: The files or targets required to build the target.
  * **Commands (recipe)**: The shell commands to execute to build the target from its dependencies. **Important: Commands *must* be indented with a real TAB character, not spaces.**

**Basic Rule Syntax:**

```makefile
target: dependencies
[TAB] command1
[TAB] command2
```

### **1.3 Compiling a Single C++ File**

Let's start with the simplest C++ program: `hello.cpp`

```cpp
// hello.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello from Makefile!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Simple Makefile for `hello.cpp`:**

1.  **Create `hello.cpp`** in your project directory.
2.  **Create a file named `Makefile`** (exactly `Makefile`, no extension) in the same directory.

<!-- end list -->

```makefile
# Makefile
# This is a comment

# Target: hello (the executable)
# Dependency: hello.o (the object file)
hello: hello.o
	g++ hello.o -o hello

# Target: hello.o (the object file)
# Dependency: hello.cpp (the source file)
hello.o: hello.cpp
	g++ -c hello.cpp -o hello.o

# Phony target for cleaning up
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f hello hello.o
```

**How to use it:**

1.  **Open your terminal** in the directory containing `hello.cpp` and `Makefile`.
2.  **To build the program:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    `make` will look for the first target in the `Makefile` that doesn't start with a dot (usually `all` or your main executable). In this case, it finds `hello`.
      * It sees `hello` depends on `hello.o`.
      * It checks if `hello.o` exists and is newer than `hello.cpp`. If not, it executes the rule for `hello.o`.
      * `g++ -c hello.cpp -o hello.o` compiles `hello.cpp` into `hello.o`.
      * Once `hello.o` is built, `make` proceeds to build `hello`.
      * `g++ hello.o -o hello` links `hello.o` into the executable `hello`.
3.  **To run the program:**
    ```bash
    ./hello
    ```
4.  **To clean up generated files:**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

### **1.4 Compiling Multiple C++ Files**

Let's expand our project.
`main.cpp`:

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "greeting.h" // Include header for our custom function

int main() {
    printGreeting();
    std::cout << "This is main." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

`greeting.h`:

```cpp
// greeting.h
#ifndef GREETING_H
#define GREETING_H

void printGreeting();

#endif // GREETING_H
```

`greeting.cpp`:

```cpp
// greeting.cpp
#include "greeting.h"
#include <iostream>

void printGreeting() {
    std::cout << "Hello from greeting.cpp!" << std::endl;
}
```

**Makefile for multiple files:**

```makefile
# Makefile for multiple C++ files

# Define compiler and flags (variables)
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -g # -Wall: All warnings, -std: C++ standard, -g: debug info

# Define the executable name
TARGET = my_program

# Define source files
SRCS = main.cpp greeting.cpp

# Define object files (derived from source files)
# The 'patsubst' function substitutes .cpp with .o
OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))

# Default target: all (builds the TARGET)
.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)

# Rule to link the executable
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $(OBJS) -o $(TARGET) $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

# Rule to compile .cpp files into .o files
# This is a pattern rule: %.o means any .o file
# $< is an automatic variable: the first dependency (e.g., main.cpp for main.o)
# $@ is an automatic variable: the target (e.g., main.o)
%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Rule to clean up
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

**How it works:**

1.  `TARGET = my_program` and `SRCS = main.cpp greeting.cpp` define variables.
2.  `OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))` calculates `OBJS` as `main.o greeting.o`.
3.  `make` or `make all`:
      * Depends on `my_program`.
      * `my_program` depends on `main.o` and `greeting.o`.
      * `make` then looks for rules to build `main.o` and `greeting.o`.
      * It finds the `%.o: %.cpp` pattern rule.
      * For `main.o`, it uses `main.cpp` as `<$` and `main.o` as `$@`. Compiles `main.cpp`.
      * For `greeting.o`, it uses `greeting.cpp` as `<$` and `greeting.o` as `$@`. Compiles `greeting.cpp`.
      * Once both `.o` files are ready, it links them using `$(CXX) $(OBJS) -o $(TARGET)`.

### **1.5 Understanding Dependencies and Targets**

  * **Target:** The file you want to create (e.g., `executable`, `object_file`, `library`).
  * **Dependency:** A file or target that must exist and be up-to-date *before* the target can be built.
  * `make` recursively checks dependencies. If a dependency is older than its target, or doesn't exist, `make` tries to build the dependency first. This is how incremental builds work.

### **1.6 Basic Variables**

We've already seen variables like `CXX`, `CXXFLAGS`, `TARGET`, `SRCS`, `OBJS`.

  * Syntax: `VAR_NAME = value`
  * Usage: `$(VAR_NAME)` or `${VAR_NAME}`

**Common Conventions for Variables:**

  * `CC`: C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
  * `CXX`: C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
  * `CFLAGS`: C compiler flags
  * `CXXFLAGS`: C++ compiler flags
  * `LDFLAGS`: Linker flags (for executable/library creation)
  * `LDLIBS`: Libraries to link against (e.g., `-lm` for math library, `-lpthread` for pthreads)

### **1.7 The `clean` Target**

The `clean` target is a convention. It doesn't produce a file named `clean`. Its purpose is to remove all generated files, bringing the directory back to a clean state.

`clean:`
`[TAB] rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)`

`.PHONY: clean` is crucial. It tells `make` that `clean` is a "phony" target, meaning it's not an actual file that `make` should try to create. This prevents `make` from getting confused if a file named `clean` accidentally exists in the directory. It ensures the `clean` commands always run when you type `make clean`.

-----

## **Part 2: Advanced Makefile Techniques**

### **2.1 Pattern Rules (`%` wildcard)**

We already used a basic pattern rule: `%.o: %.cpp`. This is extremely powerful.
It means "to build any `.o` file, find a corresponding `.cpp` file with the same base name."

**Example:**
If `make` needs `foo.o`, it looks for a rule. The pattern rule `%.o: %.cpp` matches. It then implicitly assumes `foo.o` depends on `foo.cpp`.

### **2.2 Automatic Variables (`$@`, `$<`, `$^`)**

These are special variables that `make` automatically sets for each rule it executes. They make rules more generic and reusable.

  * `$@`: The name of the target being built.
  * `$<`: The name of the *first* prerequisite (dependency).
  * `$^`: The names of *all* prerequisites, with spaces in between.
  * `$?`: The names of all prerequisites that are *newer* than the target (useful for incremental builds).
  * `$*`: The stem (the part matched by `%` in a pattern rule).

**Example using `$^`:**

```makefile
# Linking rule can be more generic
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS) # $^ is all object files, $@ is TARGET
```

### **2.3 Functions (`wildcard`, `patsubst`)**

`make` provides several built-in functions for string manipulation and file discovery.

  * `$(wildcard PATTERN)`: Expands to a list of existing files that match the `PATTERN`.
      * Example: `SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)` will find all `.cpp` files in the current directory.
  * `$(patsubst PATTERN,REPLACEMENT,TEXT)`: Performs pattern-based string replacement.
      * Example: `OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))` replaces `.cpp` with `.o` in the `SRCS` list.
  * `$(shell COMMAND)`: Executes a shell command and returns its output.
      * Example: `CURRENT_DATE = $(shell date +%Y-%m-%d)`

**Revised Makefile using `wildcard`:**

```makefile
# Makefile with wildcard
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -g
TARGET = my_program

# Automatically find all .cpp files
SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))

.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

This `Makefile` is much more robust. You can add new `.cpp` files, and `make` will automatically discover and compile them without modifying the `Makefile`.

### **2.4 Phony Targets**

We discussed `.PHONY: clean`. It's crucial for targets that don't produce a file (like `clean`, `all`, `install`, `test`). This prevents `make` from being confused if a file with the same name exists, and ensures the commands for that target always run.

### **2.5 Conditional Statements (`ifeq`)**

You can use conditionals to vary build behavior based on variables or environment.

```makefile
# Makefile with conditionals
CXX = g++

# Default build type
BUILD_TYPE ?= Debug # Use ?= for a default value if not already set

ifeq ($(BUILD_TYPE),Debug)
    CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -g -DDEBUG_MODE
else ifeq ($(BUILD_TYPE),Release)
    CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -O2 -DNDEBUG
else
    $(error Invalid BUILD_TYPE: $(BUILD_TYPE). Must be Debug or Release.)
endif

TARGET = my_program
SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))

.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

**How to use:**

  * `make`: Builds in Debug mode (default).
  * `make BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Builds in Release mode.
  * `make BUILD_TYPE=Foo`: Will trigger an error message.

### **2.6 Including Other Makefiles**

For very large projects, you might split your `Makefile` into smaller, modular files.

`config.mk`:

```makefile
# config.mk
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -g
LDFLAGS =
LDLIBS = -lpthread # Example: linking to pthreads
```

`Makefile`:

```makefile
# Main Makefile
include config.mk # Include variables from config.mk

TARGET = my_program
SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))

.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

This is useful for sharing common configurations or managing different parts of a complex project.

### **2.7 Managing Header Dependencies**

One limitation of basic Makefiles is that they don't automatically track changes in header files (`.h`). If `main.cpp` includes `greeting.h`, and you change `greeting.h`, `make` might not know to recompile `main.cpp` (unless `main.cpp` itself changed).

To fix this, compilers (like `g++`) can generate dependency files (`.d` files).

**Advanced Rule for Header Dependencies:**

```makefile
# Makefile with automatic header dependency generation
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17 -g
TARGET = my_program
SRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
OBJS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.o,$(SRCS))
DEPS = $(patsubst %.cpp,%.d,$(SRCS)) # Dependency files

.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $^ -o $@ $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

# Rule to compile .cpp into .o AND generate .d (dependency) files
%.o: %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MP # -MMD: generate .d, -MP: add phony targets for headers

# Include all generated dependency files
# This line tells make to read these .d files, which contain rules like:
# main.o: main.cpp greeting.h
# greeting.o: greeting.cpp greeting.h
-include $(DEPS) # The '-' before include prevents errors if .d files don't exist yet
```

Now, if you modify `greeting.h`, `make` will automatically detect that `main.cpp` and `greeting.cpp` depend on it and recompile `main.o` and `greeting.o` as needed.

### **2.8 Debugging Makefiles**

  * `make -n`: "Dry run". Shows what commands `make` *would* execute without actually executing them. Invaluable for debugging.
  * `make -d`: Prints detailed debugging information about how `make` is processing the `Makefile` and its rules. Can be very verbose.
  * `$(info TEXT)`: Prints `TEXT` to standard output during the `Makefile` parsing.
      * Example: `$(info Debugging: OBJS = $(OBJS))`
  * `$(error TEXT)`: Prints `TEXT` to standard error and stops `make` execution. Useful for sanity checks or catching invalid inputs.
      * Example: `ifeq ($(VAR),) $(error VAR is not set!) endif`

-----

## **Part 3: Introduction to CMake**

### **3.1 Why CMake? The Problem it Solves.**

Makefiles are powerful, but they have limitations, especially in larger, cross-platform projects:

  * **Platform-specific:** Makefiles are inherently tied to Unix-like `make` utilities and GCC/Clang. If you need to build on Windows with Visual Studio, you'd need a completely different build system (e.g., MSBuild projects) or a separate Makefile.
  * **Complexity for large projects:** While possible to manage dependencies, large Makefiles become unwieldy and hard to maintain manually.
  * **Library discovery:** Finding and linking against external libraries (like Boost, OpenCV, Qt) is often manual and error-prone with Makefiles.
  * **IDE integration:** Makefiles don't directly integrate with IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, or CLion.

**CMake** (Cross-Platform Make) is a **meta-build system**. It doesn't compile your code directly. Instead, it **generates** platform-specific build files (like Makefiles for Unix, Visual Studio project files for Windows, Xcode projects for macOS, Ninja build files, etc.) from a higher-level, platform-independent `CMakeLists.txt` script.

**Benefits of CMake:**

  * **Cross-platform:** Write one `CMakeLists.txt` for all platforms.
  * **Simplified dependency management:** Built-in functions to find common libraries.
  * **IDE Integration:** Generates project files that IDEs can open and understand.
  * **Modularity:** Excellent support for organizing large projects with sub-projects.
  * **Out-of-source builds:** Keeps your source directory clean by putting all build artifacts in a separate directory.

### **3.2 Basic `CMakeLists.txt` Structure**

A `CMakeLists.txt` file uses CMake's own scripting language. It's a series of commands and variables.

**Example `CMakeLists.txt` (Hello World):**

`hello_cmake.cpp`:

```cpp
// hello_cmake.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello from CMake!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

`CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt for a simple executable

# Minimum required CMake version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10) # Good practice to specify a modern version

# Define project name
project(HelloWorld CXX) # Project name, and languages used (CXX for C++)

# Add an executable target
# This command tells CMake to create an executable named 'hello_cmake'
# from the source file 'hello_cmake.cpp'
add_executable(hello_cmake hello_cmake.cpp)
```

### **3.3 Out-of-Source Builds**

This is a fundamental CMake best practice. You never build directly in your source directory.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create source directory:** `mkdir my_project`
2.  **Place `hello_cmake.cpp` and `CMakeLists.txt`** inside `my_project`.
3.  **Create a separate build directory (outside `my_project` or inside but named `build`):**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
4.  **Run CMake to configure the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake .. # '..' tells CMake to look for CMakeLists.txt in the parent directory
    ```
    This step generates the platform-specific build files (e.g., `Makefile` on Linux/macOS, `Visual Studio Solution.sln` on Windows).
5.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build . # This is a generic command that tells CMake to run the generated build system
    # OR:
    # make # If CMake generated Makefiles
    # msbuild MyProject.sln # If CMake generated Visual Studio files on Windows
    ```
6.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./hello_cmake # On Linux/macOS
    # Or navigate to Debug/Release folder on Windows
    ```

**Benefits:**

  * Keeps your source code clean, free from intermediate build files.
  * Easy to clean the build by just deleting the `build` directory.
  * Allows multiple build configurations (e.g., `build_debug`, `build_release`) from the same source tree.

### **3.4 Compiling Multiple C++ Files**

Let's reuse our multi-file example: `main.cpp`, `greeting.h`, `greeting.cpp`.

`CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt for multiple C++ files

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyMultiFileProject CXX)

# Add an executable target from multiple source files
add_executable(my_program
    main.cpp
    greeting.cpp
)

# You can specify C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON) # Ensure compiler supports it
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)      # Don't use compiler-specific extensions

# Add include directories if headers are in a separate folder
# If greeting.h was in an 'include' folder:
# include_directories(include) # OBSOLETE in modern CMake
# Use target_include_directories instead (see Part 4)
```

**Build process remains the same:**

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./my_program
```

### **3.5 Defining Executables and Libraries**

  * `add_executable(target_name source1.cpp source2.cpp ...)`: Creates an executable.
  * `add_library(target_name [STATIC|SHARED|MODULE] source1.cpp source2.cpp ...)`: Creates a library.
      * `STATIC`: Creates a static library (`.a` on Linux, `.lib` on Windows). Linked directly into the executable.
      * `SHARED`: Creates a shared library (`.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS, `.dll` on Windows). Loaded at runtime.
      * `MODULE`: Creates a module library (like a plugin), not usually linked directly.

**Example with a Library:**

Project structure:

```
my_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
└── my_library/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── library.h
    └── library.cpp
```

`my_project/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyFullProject CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add a subdirectory for the library
add_subdirectory(my_library)

# Add the main executable
add_executable(my_app main.cpp)

# Link the executable to the library
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE MyLibrary)
```

`my_project/main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "library.h" // Assuming library.h is correctly found

int main() {
    printLibraryMessage();
    std::cout << "Main application running." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

`my_project/my_library/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt for MyLibrary

# Create a static library named MyLibrary
add_library(MyLibrary STATIC
    library.cpp
)

# Tell consumers of this library where to find its headers
# INTERFACE means these are needed by things that *use* MyLibrary, not MyLibrary itself
target_include_directories(MyLibrary PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
```

`my_project/my_library/library.h`:

```cpp
#ifndef MY_LIBRARY_H
#define MY_LIBRARY_H

void printLibraryMessage();

#endif // MY_LIBRARY_H
```

`my_project/my_library/library.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "library.h"
#include <iostream>

void printLibraryMessage() {
    std::cout << "Message from MyLibrary!" << std::endl;
}
```

**Build Process:**

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./my_app
```

### **3.6 Setting C++ Standard**

We've already seen:
`set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`
`set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`
`set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)`

This is critical for ensuring your code compiles with a specific C++ standard across different compilers and platforms.

### **3.7 Building and Running a CMake Project**

  * **Configure:** `cmake <path_to_source_dir>` (e.g., `cmake ..` from `build`)
  * **Build:** `cmake --build <path_to_build_dir>` (e.g., `cmake --build .` from `build`)
  * **Clean:** `cmake --build <path_to_build_dir> --target clean` (or just delete the build directory)
